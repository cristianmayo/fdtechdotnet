## The Big Picture

Before we go through the details, let's see the big picture regarding development and delivery in Software Engineering. But first, let me give you a bit of perspective by observing the figure below:

![Figure 1 - Learning Overview](/assets/svg/learning-overview.drawio.svg)

In the above figure, three (3) vital components of software engineering work together to create and maintain software systems - Development, Operations, and Infrastructure. Here's what each of these components entails:

- **Development**: This is the process of creating software applications. It typically involves designing, coding, testing, and documenting software. Developers use programming languages, software libraries, and frameworks to write code that meets the software specification requirements.

- **Operations**: This involves maintaining and supporting the software system after deployment. This includes monitoring the system for errors, troubleshooting issues, and optimizing performance. Operations teams also ensure the system is secure and compliant with industry regulations.

- **Infrastructure**: Refers to the physical and virtual resources supporting the software system. This can include servers, databases, networks, and other hardware and software components. Infrastructure engineers design and manage these resources to ensure they are reliable, scalable, and secure.

These three components work together in software engineering to create a functional, reliable, and efficient software system. Developers write the code that makes up the software application, while operations teams ensure that it runs smoothly and meets users' needs. Finally, infrastructure engineers design and manage the physical and virtual resources that support the software system, ensuring that it can handle the demands of its users.

Software engineering involves planning, designing, building, deploying, and maintaining software systems. It requires a team of skilled professionals with various technical and non-technical skills, including programming, project management, and communication. Developing, operations, and infrastructure teams can create software systems that meet users' needs and provide value to businesses and organizations by working together.

## Software Development and Delivery

Software development and delivery are distinct but interconnected processes essential for creating and delivering high-quality software products. In general, software development refers to the process of designing, developing, and testing software applications. In contrast, software delivery involves deploying, distributing, and maintaining those applications in production environments.

**Software Development Process**:
- Requirements Gathering: This involves understanding the software's business needs and user requirements to be developed.
- Analysis and Design: Based on the requirements, the design of the software system is created, which includes architecture, database design, and user interface design.
- Implementation: The software is developed and tested in the coding process.
- Testing: The software undergoes a series of tests to ensure it works as expected.
- Deployment: The software is deployed to a testing environment for the final round of testing before it goes live.
- Maintenance: Once the software is live, it requires ongoing maintenance, including bug fixes and updates.

**Software Delivery Process**:
- Continuous Integration: Code changes are integrated into a shared repository regularly.
- Continuous Testing: Automated testing is performed throughout development to ensure that code changes do not break existing functionality.
- Continuous Deployment: The software is automatically deployed to production environments.
- Continuous Monitoring: The software is continuously monitored to ensure that it functions correctly and detects any issues that may arise.

Software development focuses on creating software applications, whereas software delivery is concerned with delivering and maintaining those applications in production environments. While software development is a one-time process, software delivery is a continuous process that involves ongoing maintenance, updates, and bug fixes. Both approaches are crucial for delivering high-quality software products and require careful planning, execution, and monitoring to ensure success.

## Learning Process and Target Scope

Now you understand Software Engineering and the specifics of Software Development and Software Delivery at a high level. Next, let's define the learning process and targeted learning scope on this website.

The learning process is still broken down based on the above figure. However, some of the scopes will be narrowed down to some specifics as follows:

### Full-stack Web Application Development and Delivery

Full-stack web application development and delivery involve creating and delivering a web application that functions across multiple software stack layers. This includes the front-end user interface, the back-end business logic and data management, and everything in between.

### DevOps Practices and Automation

DevOps practices and automation refer to the principles and tools that enable developers and operations teams to collaborate more effectively throughout the software development lifecycle. This includes techniques such as continuous integration, continuous delivery, and infrastructure as code, which help to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software.

### Cloud Infrastructure and Architecture

Cloud infrastructure and architecture refers to the set of technologies and practices used to deploy and manage applications in the cloud. This includes infrastructure components such as servers, storage, networking, and architecture patterns such as microservices, serverless, and containers.

## Overview

Software development and delivery are distinct but interconnected processes essential for creating and delivering high-quality software products. In general, software development refers to the process of designing, developing, and testing software applications. In contrast, software delivery involves deploying, distributing, and maintaining those applications in production environments.

Here are some of the processes involved in Software Development and Software Delivery:

### Software Development Process

```

- Requirements Gathering: This involves understanding the software's business needs and user requirements to be developed.
- Analysis and Design: Based on the requirements, the design of the software system is created, which includes architecture, database design, and user interface design.
- Implementation: The software is developed and tested in the coding process.
- Testing: The software undergoes a series of tests to ensure it works as expected.
- Deployment: The software is deployed to a testing environment for the final round of testing before it goes live.
- Maintenance: Once the software is live, it requires ongoing maintenance, including bug fixes and updates.

### Software Delivery Process

- Continuous Integration: Code changes are integrated into a shared repository regularly.
- Continuous Testing: Automated testing is performed throughout development to ensure that code changes do not break existing functionality.
- Continuous Deployment: The software is automatically deployed to production environments.
- Continuous Monitoring: The software is continuously monitored to ensure that it functions correctly and detects any issues that may arise.

### Comparison Between Process

Software development focuses on creating software applications, whereas software delivery is concerned with delivering and maintaining those applications in production environments. While software development is a one-time/one-cycle process, software delivery is a continuous process that involves ongoing maintenance, updates, and bug fixes. Both approaches are crucial for delivering high-quality software products and require careful planning, execution, and monitoring to ensure success.

Here are some details that are worth checking out to understand the difference between Software Development and Software Delivery:

**Note**: Software development and Software Delivery processes may vary depending on the specific methodologies, frameworks, and tools used in a software development project. However, the above comparison provides a general overview of the key differences between the two processes.

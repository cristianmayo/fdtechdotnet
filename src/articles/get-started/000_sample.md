## Learning Process and Target Scope

Now you understand Software Engineering and the specifics of Software Development and Software Delivery at a high level in previous page. Next, let's define the learning process and targeted learning scope on this website.

The learning process is still broken down into three (3) vital areas of Software Engineering. However, some of the scopes will be narrowed down to some specifics as follows:

The above figure shows the target scope for the learning journey in this website and primarily focused on working with Web Applications.

### Full-stack Development and Delivery

Full-stack web application development and delivery involve creating and delivering a web application that functions across multiple software stack layers. This includes the front-end user interface, the back-end business logic and data management, and everything in between.

### DevOps Practices and Automation

DevOps practices and automation refer to the principles and tools that enable developers and operations teams to collaborate more effectively throughout the software development lifecycle. This includes techniques such as continuous integration, continuous delivery, and infrastructure as code, which help to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software.

### Cloud Infrastructure and Architecture

Cloud infrastructure and architecture refers to the set of technologies and practices used to deploy and manage applications in the cloud. This includes infrastructure components such as servers, storage, networking, and architecture patterns such as microservices, serverless, and containers.

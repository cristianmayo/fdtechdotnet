# Software Engineering At Glance

Software engineering involves planning, designing, building, deploying, and maintaining software systems. It requires a team of skilled professionals with various technical and non-technical skills, including programming, project management, and communication. By working together, development, operations, and infrastructure teams can create software systems that meet users' needs and provide value to businesses and organizations.

From a Software Engineer's perspective, let's see the big picture regarding development and delivery in Software Engineering by observing the figure below:

In the above figure, three (3) vital components of software engineering work together to create and maintain software systems - Development, Operations, and Infrastructure.

These three components work together in software engineering to create a functional, reliable, and efficient software system. Developers write the code that makes up the software application, while operations teams ensure that it runs smoothly and meets users' needs. Finally, infrastructure engineers design and manage the physical and virtual resources that support the software system, ensuring that it can handle the demands of its users.

Here's what each of these components entails:

- **Development** : This is the process of creating software applications. It typically involves designing, coding, testing, and documenting software. Developers use programming languages, software libraries, and frameworks to write code that meets the software specification requirements.

- **Operations** : This involves maintaining and supporting the software system after deployment. This includes monitoring the system for errors, troubleshooting issues, and optimizing performance. Operations teams also ensure the system is secure and compliant with industry regulations.

- **Infrastructure** : Refers to the physical and virtual resources supporting the software system. This can include servers, databases, networks, and other hardware and software components. Infrastructure engineers design and manage these resources to ensure they are reliable, scalable, and secure.

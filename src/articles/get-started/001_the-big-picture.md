## Software Engineering: The Big Picture

Software engineering involves planning, designing, building, deploying, and maintaining software systems. It requires a team of skilled professionals with various technical and non-technical skills, including programming, project management, and communication. Development, operations, and infrastructure teams can create software systems that meet users' needs and provide value to businesses and organizations by working together.

From a Software Engineer's perspective, let's see the big picture regarding development and delivery in Software Engineering by observing the figure below:

In the above figure, three (3) vital components of software engineering work together to create and maintain software systems - Development, Operations, and Infrastructure.

These three components work together in software engineering to create a functional, reliable, and efficient software system. Developers write the code that makes up the software application, while operations teams ensure that it runs smoothly and meets users' needs. Finally, infrastructure engineers design and manage the physical and virtual resources that support the software system, ensuring that it can handle the demands of its users.

Here's what each of these components entails:

### Development
This is the process of creating software applications. It typically involves designing, coding, testing, and documenting software. Developers use programming languages, software libraries, and frameworks to write code that meets the software specification requirements.

### Operations
This involves maintaining and supporting the software system after deployment. This includes monitoring the system for errors, troubleshooting issues, and optimizing performance. Operations teams also ensure the system is secure and compliant with industry regulations.

### Infrastructure
Refers to the physical and virtual resources supporting the software system. This can include servers, databases, networks, and other hardware and software components. Infrastructure engineers design and manage these resources to ensure they are reliable, scalable, and secure.


## Software Development and Delivery

Software development and delivery are distinct but interconnected processes essential for creating and delivering high-quality software products. In general, software development refers to the process of designing, developing, and testing software applications. In contrast, software delivery involves deploying, distributing, and maintaining those applications in production environments.

Software development focuses on creating software applications, whereas software delivery is concerned with delivering and maintaining those applications in production environments. While software development is a one-time/one-cycle process, software delivery is a continuous process that involves ongoing maintenance, updates, and bug fixes. Both approaches are crucial for delivering high-quality software products and require careful planning, execution, and monitoring to ensure success.

Here are some of the processes involved in Software Development and Software Delivery:

### Software Development Process
- Requirements Gathering: This involves understanding the software's business needs and user requirements to be developed.
- Analysis and Design: Based on the requirements, the design of the software system is created, which includes architecture, database design, and user interface design.
- Implementation: The software is developed and tested in the coding process.
- Testing: The software undergoes a series of tests to ensure it works as expected.
- Deployment: The software is deployed to a testing environment for the final round of testing before it goes live.
- Maintenance: Once the software is live, it requires ongoing maintenance, including bug fixes and updates.

### Software Delivery Process
- Continuous Integration: Code changes are integrated into a shared repository regularly.
- Continuous Testing: Automated testing is performed throughout development to ensure that code changes do not break existing functionality.
- Continuous Deployment: The software is automatically deployed to production environments.
- Continuous Monitoring: The software is continuously monitored to ensure that it functions correctly and detects any issues that may arise.

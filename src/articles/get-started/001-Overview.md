# Overview: Getting Started

Learning full-stack web application development and delivery can seem overwhelming at first, but by breaking down the learning process into smaller steps, you can make it more manageable.

Before going through the details, let's observe and discuss the below figure to see the big picture of what's in it for full-stack web application development and delivery:

In this figure, you could see the three (3) subjects for discussion:

## Development

From the word itself, this is the part where the all application development happens on which generally separated into prototyping `front-end client` and `back-end service` application.

And yes, you read it right, it is _generally_ separated into two (2).

However, there are some instances that these two (2) are not enough and it includes `integrated service` development where it involves setting up an either low-code/no-code platforms or ready-to-use third-party API of certain tools, applications, and/or services for integration use.

## Operations


## Infrastructure

In this figure, you could see area for `Full-stack Development` and `DevOps Practices`.

While composing this blog update, I was about to list a few excuses for a long time of having no post for a few months. Regardless of the details, it all goes down to two things.

**Excuses** and **Procrastination**.

And I am forcing myself to create an update for today. Again, because of some excuses which lead me to procrastinate for sure. Fortunately, I convinced myself to make progress for this website as it will be my portfolio and learning playground from then to the upcoming days.

So here are the minor updates so far...

## Current Updates

1. The Homepage has new section updates. I added the section for recent blog posts, updated the article categories section, and made some adjustments in Nunjucks files to use reusable content. I have noted this approach for reference in making an article entry in the future.

2. Reusable Nunjucts file displaying recent blog posts. I have added this new file and reused it by injecting it into the Homepage and the dedicated Blog page.

3. Reusable Nunjucts file showing recent article posts. I have added this new file and reused it by injecting it into the Home page and the dedicated Article page. However, it only shows the categories for now and not displaying any recent article posts. Yet.

4. Made a bunch of stylesheet changes related to the reusable contents. Changes were all over the place, and I haven't implemented any standards or patterns for the styles using SCSS. As for standards, I am partially using the BEM approach as I plan to learn more about other methodologies, conventions, or standards (whichever you prefer).

## Challenges And Future Plans

Time Management and the tendency to Procrastinate are my current challenges. For the solution, I am currently allotted and dedicated some time every Sunday to work on this website project.

Technicality-wise, no challenges for now since I am still at the early stage of exploring JAMStack technologies and the early stage of this website development. At the moment, I am foreseeing future challenges in handling authentication and identity management since I am using Azure Static Web Apps to host this website.

I planned to utilize Microsoft Azure service to manage user identities for this website, but that is for the future for now as I have to establish the contents and some areas of this website first.

## Conclusion

I am on the losing side in the battle with Procrastination; however, I will be on the other side soon enough. Time Management is a battle, so I am at war on all sides.

Nevertheless, I do acknowledge my misgivings and areas for me to improve.

See you on the other side (finish line after beating Procrastination)!

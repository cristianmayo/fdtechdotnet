The most specific purpose is to serve as my learning journal and as my playground to learn JAMStack technologies. And the core purpose and goal of this website are summarized in three words:

> "Learn. Experience. Improve."

Simply put, it is to learn through experience and continuously improve along the way. And this learning would be for me, for you, and for other developers (or aspiring developers) visiting this website.

This website aims to share my experience and learning journey, where I learn from experience and share insights thru journals and articles for visitors like you to learn or know other perspectives. And in turn, it would help us improve.

Let me share with you the target learning scope of this website:

The above figure shows the target learning scope of this website, primarily focusing on working with Web Applications.

As such, let me elaborate on more details.

## Core Area Overview

The above figure shows three core areas of Full-stack Web Application Development and Delivery. Let's familiarize these three with the below details:

### Web Application Development

Web App Development is the process of creating dynamic and interactive software applications accessible through web and mobile browsers. It involves designing, coding, testing, and deploying applications that can run on different devices and platforms connected to the internet.

Web application development encompasses a range of technologies and frameworks and focuses on delivering user-friendly interfaces, efficient data management, and secure communication between the client and server.

This process enables businesses, organizations, and individuals to build powerful and accessible web-based solutions for various purposes, such as e-commerce, social networking, productivity tools, etc.

### DevOps (Development + Operations)

Short for Development and Operations. It is an approach that combines software development and IT operations to streamline the software development lifecycle, which emphasizes collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery, enabling organizations to deliver software applications more efficiently and reliably.

DevOps practices involve close cooperation between development and operations teams, breaking down silos and fostering a culture of shared responsibility. And by integrating development and operations, DevOps aims to improve software quality, accelerate time to market, and enhance overall business agility.

### Cloud Infrastructure

Cloud infrastructure refers to the set of technologies and practices used to deploy and manage applications in the cloud. Cloud infrastructure component includes servers, storage, networking, and architecture patterns such as microservices, serverless, and containers.


## Learning Scope Overview

Full-stack web application development and delivery involve creating and delivering a web application that functions across multiple software stack layers.

Full-stack web application development and delivery include the front-end user interface, the back-end business logic and data management, and everything in between.

Based on the above figure, let me share more details of the two (2) main areas of scope:

### Full-stack Development

It refers to the process of designing, building, and deploying a complete web application that encompasses both the front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) components.

The scope of full-stack web application development involves a wide range and options of technologies, frameworks, and tools. And full-stack web application development aims to create a functional and interactive application that users can access and use through a web and mobile browser.

### DevOps Practices

DevOps stands for Development and Operations, which is a set of practices that aims for improvement in collaboration, communication, and integration between software development teams and IT operations teams. It focuses on streamlining the software delivery process and ensuring the rapid and reliable delivery of software products and services.

The scope of DevOps encompasses the entire software development lifecycle, including planning, coding, building, testing, deployment, operation, and monitoring. It emphasizes the need for close collaboration and shared responsibilities between development and operations teams throughout these stages.

These practices include techniques such as Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), which help to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software.

Let's look back on the above figure and observe the two target scenarios of DevOps implementation:
- (B) Scope: Continous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) without Infrastructure-as-Code
- (C) Scope: Continous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) with Infrastructure-as-Code

**(B) Scope** is the target scenario in which the DevOps practices only involve Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). In this scope, the target is to learn and share about implementing CI/CD targeting different infrastructures, such as on-premise IIS or cloud services for web applications.

On the other hand, **(C) Scope** is the target scenario that is almost the same as the (B) Scope. However, this scope is limited to Cloud Service infrastructures and architectures by implementing programmatic infrastructure management with Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC).

At the moment, I have learned the basic foundation for using Azure Resource Management (ARM) templates and Terraform to orchestrate Microsoft Azure cloud services along with the Azure DevOps Server (formerly known as Team Foundation Server or Visual Studio Team System).

### Automation

Let's look again at the above figure and see the **(A)** scope intersecting in the Full-stack Development and DevOps Practices area.

DevOps is the set of practices to achieve seamless automated development and delivery process of software applications. However, automation is wider than these practices when developing web applications.

Developers can set their development environment to automate repetitive actions, especially if they work with client-side (front-end) applications like automated local builds whenever there are changes to your scripts and styles; Or an automated process by executing a set of commands with certain Command-Line Interface (CLI).

This set of commands is possible to execute in Azure DevOps Server, and I will share more details about these automation samples in future posts.



## Conclusion

The core purpose and goal of this website is to learn from experience and continuously improve along the way. The learning and experience will be shared on this website as a learning journal. And to jumpstart the learning and experience, this website is being developed with JAMStack technologies which I have a little familiarity, and this website will serve as a playground for these technologies.

This website aims to share insights and perspectives about full-stack web application development and delivery.

This is a broad area of topic.

However, I am determined and interested to learn more about it as well as about the technologies that are available to improve productivity and resolve problems and issues.

Feel free to share your thoughts or suggestion below, and let's have a worthwhile learning journey ahead!

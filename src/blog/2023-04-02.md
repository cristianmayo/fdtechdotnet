In the last 2 weeks of March 2023, I've got a chance to work with personal projects which included updating this website. Originally, the main source-codes of this static website was stored at my own GitHub Organization on which is my playground to familiarize how to setup a dedicated page and repository for an organization.

Unfortunately, a mistake happens and I blamed it on the after effects of having several cup of coffee, taking an energy drink afterwards and having lack of sleep.

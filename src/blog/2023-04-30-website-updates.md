In this post, I want to journal the progress in developing this static-website project. This post is the first blog post for the website updates, so this will be my template for sharing future updates.

## Updates

Many updates are the content and template for the home page and article page. In addition, the pages have new sections that help navigate to top-level categories of articles - WebApp Development, DevOps Practices, and Cloud Infrastructure.

Aside from the home page and the article page, I made a few updates in page descriptions, like the description for the article page and the blog page, as well as the short description of the top-level categories of articles.


## Challenges and Solutions

Unfortunately, as usual, the development progress of this static website is too slow. I can't help it since I have to learn new technologies while working on the development updates aside from structuring and styling the contents as I prefer.

While developing the static website, I am learning how to use template languages for a static websites like Eleventy (11ty) and Front Matter. In addition, I have to plan the structure of the website's pages to serve as my portfolio website.

## Future Plans

I plan to create pages dedicated to content posts (blog and articles) and projects as part of my professional portfolio. Those pages are the priority while consolidating ideas and references for future content posts.

## Conclusion

> "A step taken is a step closer to the destination."

My progress might have been slow, but it is still better than yesterday's. I have been planning to create a personal website for a long time, and these updates indicate that I am moving from just planning to working on it. Right now, I have my updates available, and you check them out at this URL - https://fullstackdev-tech.net

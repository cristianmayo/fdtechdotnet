                    "Learn. Experience. Improve." - Every learning opportunity and learning itself leads to exposure and experience. Even the experience
                    itself is a learning opportunity. Relative experience and available opportunities lead to potential
                    improvement. That is my cycle for continuous improvement.

                    I am a learning enthusiast who is professionally interested in full-stack web application development and
                    delivery with cloud infrastructure. I have been using the .NET platform and ecosystem since I
                    started my professional journey and engaged with...
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ASP.NET Core Development - MVC and Web API</li>
                    <li>DevOps Engineering with Azure DevOps and Microsoft Azure</li>
                    <li>Full-stack Web Application Development and Delivery</li>
                    <li>Leading a small Feature Development for Web Applications</li>
                    <li>Production Support for .NET enterprise business applications</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Other than the .NET stack of technologies, I am also keen to learn more about modern JavaScript frameworks
                    and am currently engaged with development using Angular. For other frameworks, I still have a lot of room
                    for improvement and uncharted areas to cover in terms of development standards and best practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of work, I am working on personal web application projects aside from spending time for
                    personal development and passing time for hobbies. I like watching MMA fights in One Championship to
                    root for Filipino fighter athletes, and I am currently into mountain biking as a workout routine or to
                    unwind and feel some adrenaline.
